The packaging system is running wild! The candy is lying loose all over in the warehouse, the cereal is missing, and bread is stuffed in a bottle. What is going on here? The candy should be in plastic and the bread should be in a bag.

The packaging machine is running the getContainer() function to retrieve the container of a product. But something is not right...

function getContainer(product) {
  switch (product) {
		case "Bread": return "bag";
		case "Beer":
		case "Milk": return "bottle";
		case "Cerials": return "box";
		case "Eggs": return "carton";
		case "Candy": return "plastic";
		default: return null;
	}
}
